## Project Overview called "Resource Memutator"

This is the initial push of a project aimed at creating a custom Mutation Webhook called Resource Mutator. The webhook is currently in its alpha phase and is not yet production-ready. Iâ€™m learning as I develop it, exploring advanced Kubernetes concepts as an SRE/DevOps while enhancing my Go skills through hands-on experience. Any suggestions or assistance are more than welcome!

The webhook intercepts API requests when resources like Deployments or StatefulSets are created or updated. It checks if there is a difference between the requested memory and the actual memory limits. If a discrepancy is found, the webhook mutates the resource by adjusting the memory limit to match the requested memory. This helps ensure the best configuration practices are followed.

In short kubeapi will know as we will registry this custom MutatingWebhookConfiguration, you can check under the list of MutatingWebhook:

`/apis/admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1/mutatingwebhookconfigurations`

## Upcoming Improvements
 
- add label or annotations to a pod once this webhook modify (`IN PROGRESS`)
- Set custom resource quotas (like enforcing that certain types of workloads have specific resource limits based on labels or annotations).
- possibility to disable the mutations based on namespace (via env variable)
- Move the Docker build to Docker Hub (`IN PROGRESS`)
- Transition the deployment to use Helm for easier management and scalability.

Stay tuned for further updates as I push more changes!

# Testing the Mutation Webhook (manually setup atm)

- Create a Kind Cluster
First, you need to create a Kubernetes cluster using Kind. Use the following command to create the cluster based on your specific Kind configuration:

`kind create cluster --config kind_cluster_setup/kind_config.yaml`

- Build docker image locally

`cd resource-memutator/docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t resource-memutator:latest .`

- After building your Docker image locally, you'll need to load it into the Kind cluster

`kind load docker-image resource-memutator:latest`

- Install cert-manager
Use Helm to install cert-manager, which will manage your certificates for the webhook

```
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
helm repo update
helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager \
  --namespace cert-manager \
  --create-namespace \
  --version v1.15.3 \
  --set installCRDs=true
```

- Cert-manager will need a configuration to generate the certificate required for your webhook. Apply the certificate YAML file as follows:

`kubectl apply -f mutating_webhook/0_certificate_generate.yaml`

- Deploy the webhook and its configuration:

```
kubectl apply -f deploy/resource_memutaror_deploy.yaml
kubectl apply -f mutating_webhook/1_mutating_webhook_resources.yaml
```

- you should seen the pod up and running

`kubectl get pod`

then follow the log of the webhook pod

`kubectl logs resource-memutator-webhook-123 -f`

- Apply some test resources (a Deployment and StatefulSet) to verify that the webhook works as expected and logs the necessary information.

`kubectl apply -f resource_test/Deployment.yaml`
2nd test 
`kubectl apply -f resource_test/StatefulSet.yaml`

in the follow logs you should seen:

```
2024/10/06 15:42:06 Starting webhook server on port 443...
2024/10/06 15:44:03 Container 'test-container' in Deployment 'test-deployment' has mismatched memory requests and limits. Request: 64Mi, Limit: 128Mi
2024/10/06 15:44:11 Container 'busybox' in StatefulSet 'kube-system' has mismatched memory requests and limits. Request: 64Mi, Limit: 128Mi
```

# cleaup 

delete the kind cluster

`kind delete clusters kind`
